### Module Page Functions 
- searchModules()
- searchCards()
- addModule() : all fields must be filled out otherwise highlight the field that is not filled out 
- editModule() : modal popup for the user to edit the language/name of the module 
- deleteModule() : modal popup for user handling to double check if the user still wants to delete the module 
- addCard() : depends on module type, should include validation for the front/back field of the card, the tag, picture, and audio fields are optional. (3 different types of card forms need to be made.)
- editCard() : modal popup for the user to edit the front/back of the card, and to edit the picture/audio file. 
- deleteCard() : modal popup for user handling to double check if the user still wants to delete the card 
- downloadImage()
- downloadAudio() 

Super tiny fix: include module name next to the search bar on the card list side
