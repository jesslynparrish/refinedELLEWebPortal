----Form Validation when adding Modules and Terms---- 
WILL THESE FUNCTIONS BE INEFFICIENT? 
//will not include because we do not want to limit the users from using the same names for modules 
- [ ] traverse through the modules array to check if that module name is taken already or not // or does this work like autocomplete? 
- [ ] traverse through the terms array for that specific module to see if it exists already

---- Question ----
- [ ] Need to clear up the code for adding a Question, might need an API call to simplify this functionality 

---- Other ----

- [x] Super tiny fix: include module name next to the search bar on the card list side 
- [ ] Move module info above the forms when the collapse is open 
- [ ] Add information icon to inform users what the tag functionality is all about 
- [ ] Add a handbook for admin users to understand how the games will utilize the terms in the module and how to maximize their student's experience when playing the games
